		<p>If you are interested in learning about game development in Java or Android I would strongly 
		   recommend the <a href = "http://www.kilobolt.com/">tutorials</a> written by James Cho</p>
		<h3 id = "c">C programming</h3>
		<p>According to me C programming is the most important aspect to learn if you want to become a good
		   programmer.The following book was a great help to me for learning C<br>
