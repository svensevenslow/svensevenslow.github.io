		<h2>Projects</h2>
		<h3>Project: Dungeon Runner</h3>
		<p>This is the first project that I have completed.<br>
		It is a platfform game created in Java and ported to Android.It has been made using the Eclipse-Ide.<br>
		<h4>Game description:</h4>
		<ol>
		<li>The Game consists of two levels.Level 2 can be accessed only after a successful completion of 			      Level 1.</li>
		<li>It involves guiding a sprite(character) to jump between suspended platforms
		and/or over obstacles to traverse their environment.</li>
		<li>The aim of the game is to collect stars in Level 1 and the golden fruit in Level 2.</li>
		<li>While attempting to collect stars and golden fruit the player also has to fight arch enemies 			Heliboy in Level 1 and Iron Man in Level 2.</li>
		<li>The player scores a point every time he collects a star or the golden fruit.
		Ideally, the game ends with successful completion of Level 2. However falling off the platform will
		lead to sprite death and end of the game.</li>
		<li>The weapon used by the sprite is a pistol- sword which can be used to shoot bullets</li>
		</ol>
